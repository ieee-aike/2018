## Computing Medicine
#### Ophir Frieder - Georgetown University, USA


<b>Abstract:</b> Computing continues to change the landscape of nearly all 
domains, medicine included.  For instance, drug resistance is predicted 
and avoided via data mining applications; radiological reading errors 
are detected and prevented via natural language processing; and disease 
outbreak is detected early via text mining techniques.  These are but 
just some examples where computer intelligence is reshaping medical 
practice.  Specifically, we describe the monitoring of social media to 
detect disease outbreak and describe the implications of such 
surveillance schemes to healthcare planning for a major children-focused 
hospital.  We continue by describing how conventional mining approaches 
significantly improve urinary tract infection treatment plans as 
developed jointly with and for another major hospital. Finally, we 
describe automated means for the detection of differences in 
radiological readings and describe how such detection schemes are used 
in yet a third major hospital.

<b>Profile:</b> Ophir Frieder holds the Robert L. McDevitt, K.S.G., K.C.H.S. 
and Catherine H. McDevitt L.C.H.S. Chair in Computer Science and 
Information Processing and previously served as the Chair of the 
Department of Computer Science at Georgetown University. He is also 
Professor of Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Biomathematics in the 
Georgetown University Medical Center. In addition to his academic 
positions, he is the Chief Scientific Officer for UMBRA Health 
Corp.(UHC) and a Research Associate at the Institute of Information 
Science and Technology at the Italian National Research Council 
(ISTI-CNR). He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and NAI, and a Member 
of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.

## Bringing AI into Fashion
#### Sang-goo Lee - Seoul National University (SNU), South Korea

<b>Abstract:</b> The size of the global fashion market is estimated to reach $3
Trillion in 2018. This is larger than the automotive market and almost 7
times larger than the semi-conductor market. Despite its scope and
glamourous contents, the industry has been relatively low tech (in terms
of IT) and slow to move online. The nuances of style and finely
segmented products make keyword-oriented search inadequate resulting in
ineffective and often inaccurate recommendations. In response to such
shortcomings, many attempts are being made to integrate big data
analytics and social recommendations into fashion e-commerce. Further,
there has been a steady increase in applications of deep learning
oriented visual intelligence for a more refined search and user
experience. In this talk, I will review some of the recent efforts in
the field and introduce my team’s current research activities in
vectorising visual style features of fashion items.

<b>Profile:</b> Sang-goo Lee is a professor of Computer Science & Engineering
at Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea. His research interests
are in context-aware personalization, natural language processing, and
application of A.I. to business problems. The Korean language parser
KKMA, which he developed with his students, is one of the most widely
used parser in the country. He is the CEO/CTO of IntelliSys, an AI
startup he founded in 2017 specializing in fashion search and
recommendation.
