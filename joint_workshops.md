### [First International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for 3D Bigdata Processing (AI3D)](https://sites.google.com/site/ai3dbigdataprocessing)
This workshop focuses on the use of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning to improve the processing, management and analysis of 3D Bigdata and its use in the 3D mapping.

### [First International Workshop on Humans to Robots and Back （HRoBa)] (https://hroba.github.io/CfP.pdf)
This workshop aims at bringing together scientists from di˙erent areas (human-robot interaction, artificial intelligence and machine learning, assistive and rehabilitation robotics, robotic systems design, field robotics, wearable robotics, biomedical and clinical domains, etc.) which have, as research interest, a deeper understanding of humans to propose solutions which (i)	can be used by robots to safely interact, assist and cooperate with humans, or (ii)	can help at developing solutions adapted to human needs.
